# RunouwGameProject
This is a project where several runouw.com users make a game!

## How do I contribute?

Join the Runouw discord server ( Not linking here, if you are a runouw user you should know where it is ) and go to #gamecollab for information, to pitch suggestions, or hear what others have to say.

Download the [Godot game engine](http://www.godotengine.org/), it is the game engine we are using for this project. I chose it because it is easy to use, and it is totally free. They have a multitude of tutorials and documents on their website for learning how to use the engine effectively, so be sure to give them a read.

There are several ways to make contributions to this project. You can:
* Contact someone who is involved in the project by email or in the discord chat. This method works fine for art/audio assets, but it won't work nearly as well for actual code or game design.
* Download the [Github Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/), download this repository, and make a pull request
* If you like the more complex way, you can fork this repository, download [Git](https://git-scm.com/), clone to your computer, push to your forked repository, and send a pull request to the main repository.

You can find documentation for these methods in the /docs/ folder of this repository.
