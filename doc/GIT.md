This is the more complex way to make contributions to this game; however, it is also the most powerful.

1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
2. Create a github account
3. Fork this repository using the 'fork' button in the upper right.
4. In git, run `git clone {repository}`. the '{repository}' should be replaced with the url of your repository, which in most cases, should be 'https://github.com/{YourUsername}/RunouwGameProject.git'. If this is not it, then click the 'clone or download' button on YOUR repository and copy the url that shows up. Do NOT download as a zip.
5. Make changes to the game. This can be anything, like editing levels, creating levels, adding graphics, etc.
6. Run `git add *` to add all changes you have made to the game.
7. Run `git commit -m "Your commit message"` To make a 'commit'. A commit is basically a way for Git to track changes to your changes.
8. Run `git push origin master` to send those changes to YOUR repository. You will need to enter your github username and password.
9. Now you can either go back to step #5 and make more changes, or if you are ready to submit those changes, you can go to your repository in your web browser and click 'Make new pull request' to the main repository.
10. Go back to step #5 and make more changes.
