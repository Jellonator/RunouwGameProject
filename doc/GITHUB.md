If you are just a regular person who doesn't want to touch a command line with a 10-foot pole, well you are in luck! Unfortunately, Github for desktop does not have a Linux build for me to test, so instead, I have to link to tutorials and hope that you get it.

### Setting up
[Go here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started/)
The guide is set up kinda weitd, so it almost needs a tutorial on how to use on itself.
click the link that says 'setting up Github Desktop'. From here on out, click on 'next>' on the upper right to go to the next page. Whenever you see a button that says 'Mac | Windows', make sure to click the button that represents your current operating system. This will enable platform-specific instructions and may make it easier.

### Contributing
[Go here](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/)
Follow the instructions. The same rules for following the instructions in setting up applies here too.



If someone wants to change these instructions to be easier to follow, then go ahead.
