You can email me at 'jellonator00 at gmail . com' (remove spaces, replate at with @ symbol; I'm doing this so I don't get spam mail) for simple things like art assets or music.
You can also post art and music to the runouw discord in #gamecollab.
Anything regarding level design, code, etc. will be rejected. Please use Git or the Github desktop app for that.
